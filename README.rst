Description
-----------

*Race conditions tester for pytest*

Introduces **start_race** fixture to run race condition tests.


Requirements
------------

* Python 3.7+
* pytest 2.9.0+


Usage
-----

You can use **start_race** fixture in your tests as follows:

.. code-block:: python

    from time import sleep

    ACCUMULATOR = 0  # This global var is race conditions prone.

    def test_race(start_race):
        from random import randint

        def actual_test():
            global ACCUMULATOR

            increment = randint(1, 10000)

            accumulator = ACCUMULATOR
            sleep(1)  # Simulate some lag.
            ACCUMULATOR += increment

            # By that moment ACCUMULATOR should have been updated
            # by another thread. Let's try to prove it.

            # Using simple `assert` as usual for pytest.
            assert accumulator + increment == ACCUMULATOR

        # Let's run `actual_test` in 2 threads.
        start_race(threads_num=2, target=actual_test)


**start_race** accepts the following arguments:

* **threads_num** - number of threads to run simultaneously.
* **target** - actual test callable to run in threads.
